Xenoglossia is a simple string manipulation language, akin to sed.
It was created with the goal of producing surprising, fun-to-read programs which can be generated in novel manners by a computer.

An introduction to the language and its syntax can be found in the [design document](docs/design.md), and the documentation of the builtin functions can currently be found in the docstrings of the [builtins module](xenoglossia/builtins.py).

# Installation

Clone the repository, and then run:

```
python setup.py install
```

# Usage

Xenoglossia will install an executable named `xg`.
To run a program, call `xg --input STRING "xenoglossia program"`; for example:

```sh
xg --input "This is the input string" "sub 'input' 'output'"
```

You can also pipe input into stdin:

```sh
echo "This is the input string" | xg "sub 'input' 'output'"
```

# Sample programs

Replace two words in a sentence:

```
gsub "favorite" "favourite" gsub "color" "colour"
```

Rearrange the words in a sentence, then capitalize the new sentence:

```
burst " " shuffle capitalize
```
